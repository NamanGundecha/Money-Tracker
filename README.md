# Money-Tracker
This Python script provides a budget tracker that uses a class-based approach to manage income and expenses, storing data in a transactions.csv file. It features functions to add income and expenses, display a detailed history, and view a financial summary (total balance, income, expenses), with input validation and color-coded output for clarity.
